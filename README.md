### Welcome

Some facts about me and why I program:

- I started in Computational Mechanics, amazed by Matlab.

- Then I learned OOP making 2D games with Processing (subset of Java).

- After that, I took courses from my University's Computer Science department, while majoring in Mechanical Engineering. 

- Over the summer of 2018 I took up Android and web applications (with JS technologies).

- I developed a few mobile apps for class projects, but invested more time in web; doing an internship abroad and then a full-time job during most of 2020.

- Currently I'm dedicated to master's studies in Software Engineering. 

- I'm interested in Industry 4.0 and its enabling technologies; I want to become an expert and lead projects within that vertical.
