### Welcome

Some facts about me and why I program:

- Currently I'm dedicated to master's studies in Embedded & Real-Time software. 

- I'm interested in Industry 4.0 and its enabling technologies.

- One day, I want to dabble in High Performance Computing. (After all, Computational Mechanics is where I started).
