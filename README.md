### Welcome

Some facts about me and why I program:

- I started in [Computational Mechanics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fj_NyQCMNPLJ5OtAql2qc3FKChcwu_mV/view), amazed by Matlab.

- Then I learned OOP making 2D games with Processing in prof. Mark Bueno's class (Interactive Media curriculum).

- I went on to take courses from my University's Computer Science department, while majoring in Mechanical Engineering. 

- In 2018 I did an internship for a [company in my city](https://www.tecopesca.com/), learned about their production challenges and heard the term "Industry 4.0" for the first time.

- In that period I also took up Android and web applications (with JS technologies).

- I developed a few mobile apps for [class projects](https://github.com/linomp/trip_plus_plus_android), but invested [more time in web](https://www.hackerrank.com/linomp); doing an internship abroad and then a full-time job during most of 2020.

- Currently I'm dedicated to master's studies in [Software Engineering](https://www.cs.ut.ee/en/studying/software-engineering-msc). 

- I'm interested in the enabling technologies for Industry 4.0, and I want to become an expert at architecting & developing solutions in that domain.
