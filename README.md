### Welcome

Some facts about me and why I program:

- I started in [Computational Mechanics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fj_NyQCMNPLJ5OtAql2qc3FKChcwu_mV/view) during my bachelor's studies at USFQ (Ecuador).

- Then I learned OOP making 2D games with Processing in prof. Mark Bueno's class.

- I went on to take Computer Science courses (declared it as my minor), while majoring in Mechanical Engineering. 

- In 2018 during an internship in Manta (my city), I learned about production-line challenges and heard the term "Industry 4.0" for the first time.

- In that period I also took up Android (native, Java) and web applications (MERN stack).

- I developed a few mobile apps for [class projects](https://github.com/linomp/trip_plus_plus_android), but invested more time in web; going on an [internship abroad](https://3fs.si/) and then a [full-time job](https://paqtana.com/) in 2020.

- Currently I'm dedicated to master's studies in [Software Engineering](https://www.cs.ut.ee/en/studying/software-engineering-msc) in Tallinn, Estonia. 

- I'm interested in the enabling technologies for Industry 4.0, and I want to become an expert at architecting & developing solutions in that domain.
