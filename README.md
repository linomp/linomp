# Welcome :coffee:

- Hi. I'm Lino, an ecuadorian dev with roots in Mechanical Engineering.

- I'm not attached to a particular web stack, but I currently use .NET Core + Angular (for work) and FastAPI + Svelte (for fun).

- You may notice that my entire personality is based on: programming, being ecuadorian, brutal/experimental music and my cats.

- Indeed, besides programming, my favorite activities are: blasting metal albums, blasting vaporwave albums, blasting dungeon synth albums, blasting post-punk albums, blasting d-beat/crust punk albums, practicing blast beats, prioritizing social interactions related to metal or programming, and making music under the name [{Inserte Pseudónimo Aquí}](https://soundcloud.com/insertepseudonimoaqui/via-ljubljana-demo?si=d99493f02ca646ffb9aa9c0a27de3428). That's it.
