### Welcome

Some facts about me and why I program:

- I got into programming during my Mechanical Engineering bachelor's at USFQ (Ecuador) by doing [Computational Mechanics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fj_NyQCMNPLJ5OtAql2qc3FKChcwu_mV/view) projects and making PC games.

- In 2018 during an internship in Manta (my city), I learned about production-line challenges and heard the term "Industry 4.0" for the first time.

- In that period I also took up Android (native, Java) and Web applications (MERN stack).

- I developed a few mobile apps for [class projects](https://github.com/linomp/trip_plus_plus_android), but invested more time in web; working on a [medical practice management system](https://www.iryo.io/) for [3FS d.o.o](https://3fs.si/) (Slovenia, 2019) and material requirements planning software for [Paqtana Ltd.](https://paqtana.com/) (remote, 2020).

- Currently I'm pursuing a master's degree in [Software Engineering](https://www.cs.ut.ee/en/studying/software-engineering-msc) in Estonia.

- I'm interested in the enabling technologies for Industry 4.0, and I want to become an expert at architecting & developing solutions in that domain.
